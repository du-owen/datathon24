# datathon24
Repo of team Unpredictables for think-cell challenge at Datathon 2024 hosted by Analytics Club at ETH.

## Datathon
The Datathon, organized by the Analytics Club at ETH Zurich, is Switzerland's largest hackathon dedicated to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The 2024 edition took place from April 26 to 28, bringing together over 150 participants

## Challenge
The challenge giver ThinkCell approached us with Images of PieCharts, and the goal was to use computer vision (deep learning) techniques to find out the size of each pie chart segment. Those segments need to be returned starting with the first segment at 12 o'clock of the pie chart. 

Our team, consisting of three Data Science MSc students from ETH Zurich, had 24h to complete the challenge.

## Evaluation and Ranking
There was a Kaggle competition and the outputs were rated using the pie chart metric from the [ChartOCR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/12/WACV_2021_ChartOCR.pdf) paper.

Our team managed to receive first place on the public and private leaderboard, with a score of around 0.9/1.
